# Travel Journal - Individual Project React

Travel Journal is a personal travel journal/diary, a place to collect and organize journal entries related to your travels.

In the project I am using [my own data sets](https://github.com/mikaelalundstrom/json-data/tree/main/travel-journal) for some default entries and for the different location types. I am also using [REST Countries](https://restcountries.com/#endpoints-region) to get the list of countries for each continent.

## The Design

While the design for Travel Journal is inspired by vacation postcards, stamps, plane tickets, it still has the structure and some familiar elements of modern web design such as rounded corners, pill-shaped buttons, icons [(from Phosphor)](https://phosphoricons.com/) and so on. In this way the design feels fresh, familiar, and nostalgic all at the same time.

The page was designed with desktop in mind, but is responsive with mobile screen sizes and dimensions.
